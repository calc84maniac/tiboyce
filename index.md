TI-Boy CE is a Game Boy emulator for the TI-84 Plus CE and the TI-83 Premium CE
graphing calculators.

Now supports both the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color, but not Super Game Boy
(and never Game Boy Advance).

This emulator is currently in the alpha state, so while it is intended to be
stable, it is possible that it could crash and cause data loss. It is advised
to put any important files in Archive memory before running the emulator.
