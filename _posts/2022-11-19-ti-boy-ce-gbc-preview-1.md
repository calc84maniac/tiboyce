I took some new gameplay footage from the upcoming Game Boy Color support:

Development is mostly complete, while doing game testing to find remaining issues. As of this post, there's a specific bug that causes random crashes in multiple games, but it's been difficult to replicate it in a way that I can identify the problem. As soon as this bug is squashed, there won't be much standing in the way of a release. Wish me luck!
