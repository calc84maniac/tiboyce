All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [HEAD](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/compare/v0.1.1...HEAD)

## [Alpha v0.1.1 — 2018-07-28](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

### Added
-   Support for loading ROMs up to 4MB, increased from 2MB.
-   Key names for TI-83 Premium CE in the control options.

### Changed
-   Display the paletted white-equivalent color when the Game Boy screen is off, rather than pure white.
-   Rearrange the emulator menu and reset the main menu option after (re)starting a game.
-   Output ROM converter errors to the standard error stream.

### Fixed
-   Fix sprites not displaying when an OAM DMA transfer is initiated mid-frame.
-   Check for the RET instruction returning to a different ROM bank than its corresponding CALL. Fixes some crashes in specific games (e.g. Street Fighter II).
-   Prevent a JIT overflow from overwriting the code path to the flush handler when decoding a banked CALL. Fixes some erratic crashes.

## [Alpha v0.1.0 — 2018-06-19](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

### Added
