## [HEAD](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/compare/v0.3.1...HEAD)

## [Alpha v0.3.1 — 2025-08-22](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/releases/tag/v0.3.1)

### Added
-   Linear upscaling mode for fullscreen, using flicker-based blending.
    -   The previous, slightly faster, nearest-neighbor upscaling mode is still available.
-   Enhanced ROM trimming, allowing the ROM converter to further reduce the size of certain ROMs.
-   Joypad interrupt support, along with increased key polling rate.
-   Screen rotation option, to allow flipping the calculator 180 degrees to put the arrow keys on the left.
    -   The configured arrow keys are also automatically rotated in this mode.

### Changed
-   Online ROM converter is now compiled to WASM instead of JavaScript.
-   User-configured A, B, Menu buttons can now be used to control the menu.
    -   Also, the control configuration menu can now be navigated using all four arrow keys.
-   Expansion of 15-bit color to 18-bit now uses an intensity bit, producing more consistent grays.
-   LCD SPI initialization for Python models now uses a direct method instead of reinitializing all hardware.
-   Various optimizations.
    -   Use the hardware stack protector to optimize call stack emulation.
    -   Reduce complexity of DAA emulation, with more consistent timing for different cases.
    -   Optimize zero flag reset for ADD SP instructions.
-   Internal restructuring to ease development of future features.
    -   Modularize large code files into smaller, categorized files.
    -   Make direct memory reads hookable, which supports the enhanced ROM trimming but has more potential uses.
    -   Make accesses to save state data indirect, allowing for prior memory insertion (e.g. dynamic library loading).

### Fixed
-   Fix incorrect rounding for ROM bank trim length. Fixes Dragon Warriors Monsters 2: Cobi's Journey.
-   Treat STOP opcode as 2 bytes. Fixes Dr. Rin ni Kiitemite! - Koi no Rin Fuusui.
-   Fix stack usage in RST slow case, fix direct stack pointer adjustment. Fixes The Machine.
    -   Also, prevent hard crashes if a bug causes the SPS and SPL stacks to desync.
-   Allow throttling non-rendered frames to reduce dropped inputs.
-   Fix flickering in screen transitions and menu redrawing.
-   Fix some cases where the emulator message overlay would become corrupted.
-   Prevent turning off the calculator during the Garbage Collect prompt, which would leak memory.

## [Alpha v0.3.0 — 2022-12-04](https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

### Added
-   Game Boy Color support.

### Changed
-   Confirmation setting for Load State now also applies to Restart Game.

    -   Mark per-game options instead of global options with an asterisk.
    -   Improved menu item alignment and font.
-   Majorly rewrite the CPU emulation to improve performance and flexibility of memory access emulation.
    -   Rearrange the JIT's static register allocation and the ABI of routines called from it.
    -   Remove dynamically-generated per-opcode memory routines, reducing overhead of memory region selection.
    -   For special memory accesses (I/O reads or non-RAM writes), dynamically generate minimal trampolines instead.
    -   For writes to MBC registers, directly use a routine for the specific register to remove range-checking overhead.
    -   Always pass valid timing info to memory accesses which may require it, removing the need for validity checks.
    -   Enable complex memory instructions to directly read/write RAM, such as bitwise operations and INC/DEC (HL).
    -   Allow absolute reads/writes to have variable-length implementations, for better performance with banked memory.
    -   Change stack bounds-checking to speed up close SP modifications (INC/DEC/ADD SP) and free up a register.
    -   Use inclusive bounds for the stack to avoid thrashing when touching the high edge of a memory region.
    -   Improve performance of return prediction by ignoring the stack offset unless the prediction misses.
    -   Improve performance of self-modifying code checks by using 24-bit comparisons.
    -   Improve performance of self-modifying JP instructions by using dynamic dispatch instead of recompiling.
    -   Expand the list of supported instructions in waitloop detection to reduce false negatives.
    -   Optimize ROM bank switching routine at ROM load time based on the ROM size, to eliminate redundant masking.
    -   Simplify MBC3 RTC bank switching by handling RTC updates immediately before register writes.
-   Refactor the PPU scheduler to speed up writes to STAT and LYC registers.
    -   Predict future writes to the LYC register based on previous frames, to avoid excessive rescheduling.
    -   Remove post-vblank event cache to simplify all reschedules, and determine the event only when vblank is reached.
